# Market-Making-and-RL
Defining a reinforcement learning algorithm for optimal market making.

This repository houses both the report and the code for an assignment I completed.

The initial two parts of the assignment are unrelated to financial services.

The third part involves the application of a reinforcement learning agent to solve a simple board game. The code was provided, and my task was to interact with it.

The final part focuses on defining a reinforcement learning agent tailored for market-making purposes. The report thoroughly outlines the theoretical aspects of the agent, while the code contains functions that define the agent's state space. The code is implemented in Python using Lobster data.
